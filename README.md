# employee-payroll-tracker
## Webpage that tracks employee payrolls.

## Description
I created this webpage/application to help insert and average out employee salaries in an easy to read elementary way. Making this repo was practice and review of what I can do from the basic material that I've learned so far. Overall, it performs the function to intake data from the user and display it back with some other features within the console log.

## Installation
All you have to do is access the deployed URL provided here:
https://kushonim.github.io/employee-payroll-tracker/

## Usage
Upon opening the webpage, you are prompted with a button to add employee information. By following the required employee data that is being asked, the program should flow reliably. One note is to make sure to only input integers/numbers into the salary section as the program will automatically format it for you.

## Features
The program intakes employee data and displays them to as many employees that you'd like to add. It also calculates the average salary of all employees and selects a random employee as a "winner" by default.
